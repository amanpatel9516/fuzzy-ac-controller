✨ fuzzy-ac-controller-final

This project is about building a smart AC Controller using fuzzy logic.
We have explained how the controller works and how it reacts to real-world environment data.

🔧 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, also further we are going to add ml functionalities to it .

Algorithms: DAA-based logic for generating graphs

Environment-Based Working: Controller decisions adapt to real sensor-like inputs

🚀 Today's Update

Today we added an important new functionality that makes the controller more meaningful and accurate.
We also introduced more tech stack elements and optimized the code for faster performance and better structure.

📈 Progress

The project is improving day by day as we refine logic, UI, and performance
